# slow
Slowdown terminal input

This program implements a "pipe", i.e. it reads data from its standard input
device (stdin) and outputs data to its standard output device (stdout).

The sole purpose of this program is to simulate the "slow input" of an old
terminal device connected to a serial line at a particular speed (baud rate).
This can be used to "play" ancient "VT100 Videos" (aka animations) at about
the same speed they would have been seen at a terminal in the 1980's.
